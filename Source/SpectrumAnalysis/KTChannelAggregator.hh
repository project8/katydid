     @brief Multiple channel summation for Phase-III and IV
     
     @details
     More details to come.
     
     Configuration name: "channel-aggregator"
     
     Available configuration options:
     - "active-radius": double -- The active radius of the detection volume
     - "grid-size": signed int -- Size of the grid; If square grid is considered, the number of points in the grid is the square of grid-size
     - "use-grid-text-file": bool, -- Check whether to define the grid based on an input text file 
     - "grid-text-file": : std::string, -- Text file which has the user-defined grid positions 
     - "wavelength": double -- Wavelength of the cyclotron motion
     - "min-freq": double -- The minimum frequency value above which the channel aggregated spectrum is calculated. This particularly helps in enforcing bramforming around the central peak and avoiding side bands
     - "max-freq": double -- The maximum frequency value below which the channel aggregated spectrum is calculated
     - "use-antispiral-phase-shifts": bool, -- A flad to indicate whether to use antispiral phase shifts
     - "n-rings": signed int -- Number of axial rings
 
     Slots:
     - "fft": void (Nymph::KTDataPtr) -- Adds channels voltages using FFTW-phase information for appropriate phase addition; Requires KTFrequencySpectrumDataFFTW; Adds summation of the channel results; Emits signal "fft"
     
     Signals:
     - "fft": void (Nymph::KTDataPtr) -- Emitted upon summation of all channels; Guarantees KTFrequencySpectrumDataFFTW
