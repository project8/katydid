~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Release Date: October 2, 2017
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

New Features:
'''''''''''''

* ROOT Spectrogram Writer: sequential writing mode
    * A new mode of writing was added to the writer that writes sequential spectrograms of a given time size.
    * Documentation is included in the KTROOTSpectrogramWriter header documentation.
    * The new writing mode was tested on a concatenated file from an RSA run. Sequential spectrograms split at the right times according to the setting and acquisition breaks.
    * The old writing mode ("single") continued to function in the same way.

Fixes:
''''''

* Egg3 reader: Fixeed filling of frequencies (min/max/center)

* Monarch: updated to v3.4.6
    * Fixed the string-attribute-length bug.
    * Validated by testing on an egg file with a long description attribute. File opened and read correctly.

* Consensus Thresholding NaN fix
    * For vertically-aligned points, the CT algorithm would calculate an NaN slope, but the algorithm did not crash. This special case is now handled without calculating a slope.
    * Validated by observing the debug output of the CT processor when processing a data file, and seeing that no NaN or inf values were present.

* Egg3 reader: crashed on reading second file and beyond in multi-file runs
    * The reader was not picking up the first record number in the file, which was non-zero for the second file and beyond in a multi-file run.
    * This was fixed by adjusting the variable that tracks that record number immediately after the first record was read.
    * This was validated by analyzing a non-first-file in a multi-file run and seeing that the record number was correct in the debug output.  Run number 3870 was used.
